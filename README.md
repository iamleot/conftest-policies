# conftest-policies

This repository contains personal [conftest](https://www.conftest.dev/)
policies that are used to check code and try to reach as much as
possible a good level of DRY (don't repeat yourself).

**NOTE**: "personal" here means that some of them could be
opinionated, some of them could be also possibly wrong in several
possible contexts, beware!

## Packages

Each collection of packages has its own documentation:

- [data.github.actions.workflows.\*](./policy/github/actions/workflows/README.md)
- [data.github.dependabot.\*](./policy/github/dependabot/README.md)
- [data.venom.\*](./policy/venom/README.md)
- [data.terraform.aws.\*](./policy/terraform/aws/README.md)

Documentation can be (re)generated by running `make docs` target.

## Testing

When adding/deleting/modifying policies the following `make` targets
should be run:

```console
make check-fmt
make lint
make test
```

...to ensure that policies are properly formatted, linted and tested.
